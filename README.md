Because this game was a school project with a deadline, I didn't have enough time to fix all the bugs so I'll list them here and you'll be able to play :

How to full enjoy this experience :
    - if you want to play with someone, first you have to be both on the "/" url, it means you have to be both logged in before opening a new room, otherwise the other player won't be able to see the room you created.
    - it might not work if you use a browser different that google chrome ðŸ¥º ...

more about my project : 
    - my first idead was to create a "Qui est ce" game, but I met some problems with websocket, the turn by turn logic so I changed my idea of game 2 weeks before the deadline after long hours of work without any real improvement. If you are curious you can find the code I worked in here : https://github.com/fantinerudent/jeumulti

you can also check my first project which was a CV game, to find more about me here : https://fantinerudent.github.io/ .. a front game full Javascript/html/css ...

And finally, during my internship I am learning React , I try to improve my knowledge by developping a TodoList that you can find on my repositories, named : 'todo-basique' ...

Have fun !
